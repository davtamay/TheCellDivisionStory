# The Cell Division Story
Proof of concept project done for a [Learning and the Body Curriculum and Instruction course at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana](https://education.illinois.edu/course/CI/556). It aimed to show how body movements can be used to promote constructing new knowledge.

## Designer Collaborators
Inspired by [Taehyun Kim's](http://www.taehyun.space/) VR Digital learning research idea of ChromosoMe. This was also made possible with the help of Brian Guerrero and Kevin Hall graduate students in the Digital Environments for Learning, Teaching and Agency concentration.

## Experiential Learning through body movements
Being only a prototype to design ideas of an area of research, the applications shows different phases within the procedure of using one's body to learn concepts. 

## Unity Project
The project was build to webgl using WebXR specifications, it could be used through mobile, desktop and virtual reality (although, the controlls using a headset are not setup currently). Building it for the web offer the ability to test it when it was being presented in the courese (I provided the project here, but if there is interest for a live demo, I can rebuild it again, and share it here).

## Features Developed
- Game mechanics such as being able to invoke events after bringing certain elements into a game object.
- Models were all created using Blender.
